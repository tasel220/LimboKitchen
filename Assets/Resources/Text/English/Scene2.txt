Dialogue
Restaurant	BaekYum
Main Character : Are you okay with the wound?
??? : (아픈 미소) Oh, It's really nothing, my child. But thank you for your good intentions.
Main Character : How did you get hurt like this?
??? : (아픈) I was in a hurry to do something urgent, but I got caught in the root of the tree. On a slippery slope...
??? : (아픈) After that, my whole body ached and I couldn't move.
Main Character : That could have been a real disaster.
??? : (아픈) Anyway, what were you doing there alone?
Main Character : I was lost in the fog. I couldn't even tell where I was on the map.
??? : (아픈) Can I take a look at that?
??? : (아픈 의미심장한) Let me see...
??? : (아픈) I think you've come to the right place. From here, all you have to do is follow the trail behind this restaurant.
Main Character : Really?
??? : (망설이며) Um... but...
Main Character : ...?
??? : (아픈) I'm not really sure whether it's a good idea.
??? : (아픈) It's such a narrow and rough path that you might get hurt badly on a foggy day like these days.
??? : (아픈) Why don't you stay here for a while until the fog clears?
??? : (아픈) There's one room left for you to stay in.
Main Character : Yeah, but... I don't have much money now.
Main Character : I don't know if I can afford the accommodation.
??? : (아픈 의미심장한) I see...
??? : (아픈 미소) That's great!
Main Character : Pardon?
??? : (아픈) I thought about closing the store for a few days because of an urgent matter just before we meet.
??? : (아픈) Can you take care of this place while I'm away?
??? : (아픈) I don't have many visitors, but I always have one or two a day.
??? : (아픈) They have come all the way to my shop, and I can't just let them go back.
??? : (아픈) I'll pay you enough for your part-time job! Of course, I won't charge you for accommodation.
Main Character : It's a very grateful offer to me, but...
Main Character : Are you sure you're okay with that? You can leave the store to someone you've never seen before?
??? : (아픈 미소) Of course. I can tell it right away what's inside your mind at a single glance.
Main Character : Um...
Main Character : Then just for a few days...
??? : (아픈 미소) Good for you!
Ms. Back : (아픈) Well... Come to think of it, we don't even know each other's names. My name is Back-hee. People also call me Ms. Back.
Dawn : I'm Dawn.
Ms. Back : (아픈) Nice to meet you, Dawn. Now I'll show you where to stay.
