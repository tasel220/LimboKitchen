??? : (쓸쓸한) ...
??? : Looking at you like this keeps reminding me of the past.
??? : Isn't it strange that some memories become more vivid over time?
choice	I don't understand what exactly do you mean...	Can I hear what you're talking about?
??? : (쓸쓸한) It's a long story.
??? : I was born as the first daughter of a poor farmer in a mountain village.
??? : At that time, my parents had so little that they could earn a living by farming other people's fields.
??? : We haven't had much improvement since then, but we've been satisfied with our own lives.
??? : Then one day, a big war broke out.
??? : Flames and smoke rose everywhere, and people's screams echoed through the valleys.
??? : (굳은) I still clearly remember my father holding my hand tightly and running with all his might.
Dawn : You experienced something really... terrible.
??? : It took a long time for the end of the war.
??? : Fortunately, my family were all safe in the midst of that chaos, but everything we had have been devastated.
??? : To ease the burden on my family, I married a man I didn't know his name or face.
Dawn : That must have been a tough choice.
??? : It was inevitable. And it was common in those days.
??? : But he was at least a diligent person.
??? : Because he had some property inherited from his parents, I thought there would be no problem if we worked hard enough.
??? : My husband wanted to go out to the city and do business.
??? : I was worried but I said yes because I don't think I can stay in my completely ruined hometown.
??? : Things went better than I thought at first. We quickly settled down and soon we even had a baby.
??? : My tiny little boy...
??? : (웃으며) Yes, the one who looks just like you.
choice	Do I look that much alike?	That's why you kept staring at me.
??? : (웃으며) That's right.
??? : But then everything started to go wrong.
??? : (굳은) My husband, that man started to show his true nature when things got better.
??? : At first I thought he was sick or something.
??? : The hard-working man kept taking a break from work, even leaving his seat empty during the business.
??? : I couldn't believe it when I heard he was in and out of gambling.
??? : I thought he'd never do that.
??? : That night, I tried to feel him out. I asked him where he's been going these days and why he keeps leaving his seat empty.
??? : Then something unbelievable happened.
??? : (굳은) Suddenly he slapped me in the face.
Dawn : ...
??? : (굳은) I haven't noticed what happened in a while.
??? : (굳은) I didn't even feel the pain. I just stared blankly at the man who was once my husband.
??? : (굳은) That man didn't stop there, but he started beating me up.
??? : (굳은) When I couldn't breathe properly, he stopped punching.
??? : (굳은) I didn't even know why I should be treated like that.
??? : (굳은) I couldn't believe myself whether he was really my husband or the man I knew.
??? : (굳은) The next day he acted as if nothing had really happened.
??? : (굳은) I would have thought yesterday was my dream if it hadn't been for the bruises left all over my body.
??? : (굳은) But even after that, he hit me frequently.
??? : (굳은) Because I talked back or I didn't set the meal on time, even sometimes he was just in a bad mood, I had to be beaten for all sorts of reasons.
Dawn : ...
Dawn : Then... anyone...
??? : (슬픈 미소) Do you want to ask if anyone noticed that? Or did anyone in your neighborhood or acquaintance help you?
Dawn : ...
??? : (쓸쓸한) I know. I was curious about that, too.
??? : (쓸쓸한) Why isn't anyone helping me? Do they really not know about this?
??? : (굳은) Now I feel like I should have fought that man even if I was going to die...
??? : (굳은) At that time, I had only one thought in my head.
??? : (굳은) All I had to do was protect my child, my only child.
??? : (슬픈 미소) I was foolish...
choice	But you're still amazing. You protected your son after all.	I'm sorry, but is your son...?
??? : (쓸쓸한) ...
??? : (쓸쓸한) He already passed away a long time ago.
Dawn : ...
??? : (쓸쓸한) My life is nothing but hardships. Isn't it?
??? : (쓸쓸한) I've endured terrible poverty, the flames of war, the violence of my husband somehow.
??? : (쓸쓸한) Now I'm waiting for the day when I see my child again.
Dawn : ...
??? : (슬픈 미소) I'm sorry. You must have felt a lot of pressure cause I bring up such a heavy story all of sudden.
??? : I'm going now. I've taken too much time away from young man.
