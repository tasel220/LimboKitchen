??? : This is the first time I've been to a restaurant like this by myself, so it's very awkward.
??? : It's been a long time since I had such a personal time because I was pressed for work.
Dawn : If you don't mind, may I ask what you do?
??? : I'm a police officer. It's already been more than a decade since I started this job.
Eugene : By the way, what's your name? My name is Eugene.
Dawn : I'm Dawn. So, you are the cop.
Eugene : (웃으며) You may not believe cause I'm such an ordinary-looking man, but I'm an old hand in this field.
Dawn : Then, you're here on vacation?
Eugene : Yeah, I've never used a real vacation so far because of the lack of people on duty.
Eugene : (생각난 듯) Oh, I haven't decided on the menu yet.
Dawn : If it's hard to decide, can I make whatever you want?
Eugene : Would that be okay with you?
Dawn : Of course. Please hold for a moment.
