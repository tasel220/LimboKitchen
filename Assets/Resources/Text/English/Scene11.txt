??? : Hello.
Dawn : Welcome. Do you have any company?
??? : No. Just me.
??? : I didn't know there was a restaurant here.
Dawn : Yeah, It's a bit unusual.
Dawn : 'School uniform... is she a student?'
Dawn : That's a pretty name.
Mina : Uh?
Mina : Oh, my name tags...
Mina : I hear that a lot. What's your name, uncle?
Dawn : ‘Uncle... I'm only 23 years old!’
Dawn : My name is Dawn.
Mina : Your name sounds good, too. Uncle.
Dawn : Thank you. What would you like to order?
Mina : Anything, please.
Dawn : ...What?
Mina : I wanted to order it at least once when I came to a place like this. What did people say? Today's Specials?
Dawn : But... it might not suit your taste, is that okay?
Mina : Then, there is nothing I can do. I'm prepared to some extent.
Mina : Why? You're not confident?
Dawn : ...
Dawn : Okay. Please wait a moment.
Mina : I'll look forward to it, uncle.
Mina : Oh, you're not mad at me for calling you 'uncle', are you?
