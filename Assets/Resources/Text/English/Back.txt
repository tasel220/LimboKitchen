Dawn : I'm going back.
Ms. Back : (걱정스러운) The way back will be much longer and harder than it would have been to come here. Are you sure you're okay with that?

Ms. Back : (걱정스러운) If you think so...
Ms. Back : (걱정스러운) Good luck. I hope you can get back safely.
Dawn : Thank you. Goodbye, Ms. Back, until the day we meet again.

: Well, maybe it will be alright. Even if it goes wrong, I know the consequences.
: Thinking so, I began a long journey to go back home.
